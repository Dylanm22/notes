# MSM notes
# ----- create database tables -------
Creat tables in real ruby programs: open a bash prompt 

in bash prompt: use this example to make a table and all the content for the table: 
rails generate model movie title:string year:integer duration:integer description:text image:string director_id:integer

then run: rake db:migrate in bash 
# ----- create data base tables -------

all the models made by the data base tabel (in the models folder can be used throught out the code once they are there.)
