# notes about rails
Ruby on Rails is basically just that it's a standardized set of folders and gems that all Rails developers have agreed upon so that every time you jump into a new Rails app, you don't have to learn all of what did that specific team name their files and where did they put things?

A hash literal: is written as a comma-separated list of key/value pairs, enclosed within curly braces. ex: {:controller =>"",:action =>""}

 get("/rock"{:controller =>"",:action =>""}): in rails this will be come a Class and Method that will run when on that path way 

 methods: render({:template => ""}) 


 we NOW type routes in config/routes.rb EX: get("/rock", {:controller =>"zebra",:action =>"giraffe"})
 everything eles is in app folder


 New Hash syntax 
 my_hash = { fruit: "banana", sport: "hockey" }
no =>
