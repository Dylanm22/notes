saw mary on the cta thoght it was gonna be super awkward but we just talked about it right when we came into class and it was cool. anyways i think im achully disghusting looking so i dont know what to do about that every time i look at my self i look awful i hate it. 

Just had my phone blare out some random fucking noies from the text messaging app OUT LOUD WHAT THE FUCK IS THE DAMN POINT OF PUTTING THE VOLUME DOWN IF SOME SHIT IS JUST GOING TO OVER RIDE IT WHAT IF IT WAS SOMTHING CRAZY I WAS PLAYING ON THERE IT WAS JUST A VID OF MELO AND TRINA BUT FROM AND OUTWARD LISTEN IT MAY HAVE SOUND ABSOLUTLY NUT WHAT THE ACHUAL FUCK DAMN. 

how did that sound to the outside looking in im starting to get in my own head its crazy.

okay thinking about it a bit less now but there is no doubt that people heard it cant get over that huuuuuuhhhhhh sucks to suck dont it.


what is going on with me am i good or what i need to finish sprint two by thursday cause im taking my long week end no matter what 


oho my god im disgusting i hate just looking at my self its the worst how long will this self loathing take 

MY GLASSES KEEP FALLIGN DOWN MY DAMN FACE IM BOUT TO TWEAK 


i feel like im always doing something wrong when im looking at people in passing it feels weird(felt this when passing carmen in the hallway)

im trying i swear im trying but it still feels awkward idk why 

had a very slight comments in passing with annie BRO U GOTTA STOP fr 

just asked for jasons name in front of the class i feel kinda bad but i just genuinly wanted to know thumbs down 

yeah im probably not doing any work at home today just to be fr 

but i think i can get them all done by friday 

okay kind burnt out today at around 4 so to finish the stuff for the 16 i think i can finish all my stuff by thus but the rest due on the 21st will take a bit longet sprint 3 looks shorter so i think im going to work most the week end to get it done. i think im going to wake up early on every day because i really dont want to work in the middile of at the night of my days then it feels like achula work but is should be feeling better by the weekend days so i dont think it will be too hard to wake up early then :thumbs up
